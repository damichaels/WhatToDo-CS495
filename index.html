            <p>WhatToDo is a Mobile Application designed for android devices
                that allows families, workplaces, and groups of people to be able
                to coordinate their tasks with other members of the group, so every task
                is completed evenly by each group member. WhatToDo incorporates a built-in points system to add a level of competition amongst members,
                 making doing the chores more enjoyable.
                For every task completed, a team member earns the number of points associated with that task.
                 Tasks are assigned by a groupâ€™s administrator and can be scheduled at what frequency is necessary.
                 A member can be in multiple groups at a time and join groups by entering a unique group code.
